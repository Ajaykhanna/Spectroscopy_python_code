Generalized python code that is capable of computing linear and non-linear optical response, both for input in terms of classical correlation functions and the GBOM. This code will come in a number of independent modules that allows for easy combinations between fundamentally different approaches.

Things that are done or almost done:
2a)
2b) 
2c)
2d)
2e)

Need 1, 2f) and pretty much all of 3) 
For 3) focus on 2nd order cumulant first. This just requires q as an input. 

How does FFT of the response function work? What are the symmetries of the 1D response function? What about 3D response function?

Modules:

1) Input parser:
- Reads in an imput file containing all important calculation parameters
- Can read in either trajectory files in the cumulant approach or Gaussian output files for the GBOM
- Packages up all input data into the right format and handles Unit conversion

2) Linear response:
2a) Cumulant GBOM
- All GBOM helper routines. Definition of the energy gap/mean etc. 
- Classical and quantum correlation functions
- Lineshape function q and g exactly evaluated
- SD can also be evaluated and printed

2b) Corr func from MD
- Construct classical correlation function (one- and 2 time) from MD input
- Compute SD and handle averaging etc. 
- Handles Jung quantum correction factor for 2time correlation function and can return the full one

2c) Cumulant approach
- Computes q from an input SD
- Computes g from a classical correlation function that is passed as an input. 
- Routine to compute g from time ordered integral of classical correlation function (mainly to double check?)
- returns q and g (if required)

2d) Solvent model:
- Compute a solvent spectral density with solvent parameters, generates a lineshape function for it 
  and returns it. Calls cumulant helper routine that computes a lineshape function from the spectral density

2e) Construct linear response function:
- Takes input dependent on requested calculations and construct a linear response function
- For GBOM, can return linear response function in ensemble approach, exact FTFC approach, or E-ZTFC
- Adds solvent degrees of freedom
- For Cumulant, constructs response function simply from input of dipole moment, mean and q and g. Here, it
  does not matter if q and g were computed from GBOM or exactly
- If a trajectory input of vertical excitation energies is given, can also construct ensemble or 
  E-ZTFC (if GBOM parameters are also given) spectra. 

2f) Linear spectrum:
- Takes linear response function (from whatever source) as an input and computes the linear spectrum
- This is done via an FFT. Spectrum is automatically converted into required formats. 

3) Non-linear spectroscopy
For the time being, this set of routines will be limited to 2DES and the cumulant approach
3a) 3rd oder corrections GBOM
- Take GBOM params as an input and construct the exact extra correction terms for the 3rd order cumulant 
  in 2DES. These terms have exact expressions. 
- return h1,h2,h3. h1 and h2 are 2D functions and can be computed only once. h3 is a 3D function. Make sure to keep 
  the expressions flexible enough that we don't have to evaluate the entire 3D function? Need to think about it. 

3b) 3rd order corrections MD
- Take the classical correlation function as an input to evaluate the 3rd order corrections numerically
- Otherwise same as 3)

3c) Construct 3rd order response function
- Constructs full complex response functions/ rephasing/nonrephasing

3d) 2DES
- Compute 2DES from FFTs
