In this example, a Generalized Brownian Oscillator Model (GBOM) is parameterized for 
the Nile red molecule or the Methylene blue molecule, using the output from a ground 
and excited state normal mode calculation in the Gaussian code. The .log files contain
the Gaussian output files. 

The default input file provided computes a Franck-Condon absorption spectrum. Other
approximations to linear spectroscopy can be requested by changing the METHOD keyword
to ENSEMBLE, CUMULANT or EZTFC. Alternatively, reuqesting METHOD ALL will compute the 
linear spectrum in all approximations.

By default, the cumulant spectra are computed in the 2nd order cumulant approximation.
The 3rd order cumulant correction can be requested by setting the parameter THIRD_ORDER_CUMULANT
to TRUE.
